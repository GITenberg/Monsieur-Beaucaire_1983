description: Throughout history, bit players on the sidelines have somehow become
  embroiled in the most notorious scandals, finding themselves wrapped up in intrigue
  with far-reaching consequences they could never have imagined. That's exactly what
  happens to the eponymous protagonist of Booth Tarkington's novel, Monsieur Beaucaire.
  This humble barber to the French ambassador to England finds himself at the center
  of a scandalous love triangle. Will Beaucaire be able to emerge with his honor intact?
