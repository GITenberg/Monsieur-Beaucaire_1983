    <h2>
      Chapter One
    </h2>
    <p>
      The young Frenchman did very well what he had planned to do. His guess
      that the Duke would cheat proved good. As the unshod half-dozen figures
      that had been standing noiselessly in the entryway stole softly into the
      shadows of the chamber, he leaned across the table and smilingly plucked a
      card out of the big Englishman's sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merci, M. le Duc!&rdquo; he laughed, rising and stepping back from the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman cried out, &ldquo;It means the dirty work of silencing you with
      my bare hands!&rdquo; and came at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not move,&rdquo; said M. Beaucaire, so sharply that the other paused.
      &ldquo;Observe behind you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman turned, and saw what trap he had blundered into; then stood
      transfixed, impotent, alternately scarlet with rage and white with the
      vital shame of discovery. M. Beaucaire remarked, indicating the silent
      figures by a polite wave of the hand, &ldquo;Is it not a compliment to monsieur
      that I procure six large men to subdue him? They are quite devote' to me,
      and monsieur is alone. Could it be that he did not wish even his lackeys
      to know he play with the yo'ng Frenchman who Meestaire Nash does not like
      in the pomp-room? Monsieur is unfortunate to have come on foot and alone
      to my apartment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke's mouth foamed over with chaotic revilement. His captor smiled
      brightly, and made a slight gesture, as one who brushes aside a boisterous
      insect. With the same motion he quelled to stony quiet a resentful impetus
      of his servants toward the Englishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's murder, is it, you carrion!&rdquo; finished the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Beaucaire lifted his shoulders in a mock shiver. &ldquo;What words! No, no,
      no! No killing! A such word to a such host! No, no, not mur-r-der; only
      disgrace!&rdquo; He laughed a clear, light laugh with a rising inflection,
      seeming to launch himself upon an adventurous quest for sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You little devilish scullion!&rdquo; spat out the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, tut! But I forget. Monsieur has pursue' his studies of deportment
      amongs' his fellow-countrymen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you dream a soul in Bath will take your word that I&mdash;that I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That M. le Duc de Winterset had a card up his sleeve?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You pitiful stroller, you stableboy, born in a stable&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it not an honor to be born where monsieur must have been bred?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You scurvy foot-boy, you greasy barber, you cutthroat groom&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Overwhelm'!&rdquo; The young man bowed with imperturbable elation. &ldquo;M. le Duc
      appoint' me to all the office' of his househol'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustachioed fool, there are not five people of quality in Bath will
      speak to you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monsieur, not on the parade; but how many come to play with me here?
      Because I will play always, night or day, for what one will, for any long,
      and always fair, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You outrageous varlet! Every one knows you came to England as the French
      Ambassador's barber. What man of fashion will listen to you? Who will
      believe you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All people, monsieur. Do you think I have not calculate', that I shall
      make a failure of my little enterprise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will monsieur not reseat himself?&rdquo; M. Beaucaire made a low bow. &ldquo;So. We
      must not be too tire' for Lady Malbourne's rout. Ha, ha! And you, Jean,
      Victor, and you others, retire; go in the hallway. Attend at the entrance,
      Francois. So; now we shall talk. Monsieur, I wish you to think very cool.
      Then listen; I will be briefly. It is that I am well known to be all,
      entire' hones'. Gamblist? Ah, yes; true and mos profitable; but fair,
      always fair; every one say that. Is it not so? Think of it. And&mdash;is
      there never a w'isper come to M. le Duc that not all people belief him to
      play always hones'? Ha, ha! Did it almos' be said to him las' year, after
      when he play' with Milor' Tappin'ford at the chocolate-house&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dirty scandal-monger!&rdquo; the Duke burst out. &ldquo;I'll&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, monsieur!&rdquo; said the Frenchman. &ldquo;It is a poor valor to insult a
      helpless captor. Can he retort upon his own victim? But it is for you to
      think of what I say. True, I am not reco'nize on the parade; that my
      frien's who come here do not present me to their ladies; that Meestaire
      Nash has reboff' me in the pomp-room; still, am I not known for being
      hones' and fair in my play, and will I not be belief, even I, when I lif'
      my voice and charge you aloud with what is already w'isper'? Think of it!
      You are a noble, and there will be some hang-dogs who might not fall away
      from you. Only such would be lef' to you. Do you want it tol'? And you can
      keep out of France, monsieur? I have lef' his service, but I have still
      the ear of M. de Mirepoix, and he know' I never lie. Not a gentleman will
      play you when you come to Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman's white lip showed a row of scarlet dots upon it. &ldquo;How much
      do you want?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room rang with the gay laughter of Beaucaire. &ldquo;I hol' your note' for
      seven-hunder' pound'. You can have them, monsieur. Why does a such great
      man come to play M. Beaucaire? Because no one else willin' to play M. le
      Duc&mdash;he cannot pay. Ha, ha! So he come' to good Monsieur Beaucaire.
      Money, ha, ha! What I want with money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His Grace of Winterset's features were set awry to a sinister pattern. He
      sat glaring at his companion in a snarling silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money? Pouf!&rdquo; snapped the little gambler. &ldquo;No, no, no! It is that M. le
      Duc, impoverish', somewhat in a bad odor as he is, yet command the entree
      any-where&mdash;onless I&mdash;Ha, ha! Eh, monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! You dare think to force me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. Beaucaire twirled the tip of his slender mustache around the end of his
      white forefinger. Then he said: &ldquo;Monsieur and me goin' to Lady Malbourne's
      ball to-night&mdash;M. le Duc and me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman roared, &ldquo;Curse your impudence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit quiet. Oh, yes, that's all; we goin' together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certain. I make all my little plan'. 'Tis all arrange'.&rdquo; He paused, and
      then said gravely, &ldquo;You goin' present me to Lady Mary Carlisle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other laughed in utter scorn. &ldquo;Lady Mary Carlisle, of all women alive,
      would be the first to prefer the devil to a man of no birth, barber.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis all arrange'; have no fear; nobody question monsieur's You goin'
      take me to-night&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. And after&mdash;then I have the entree. Is it much I ask? This one
      little favor, and I never w'isper, never breathe that&mdash;it is to say,
      I am always forever silent of monsieur's misfortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have the entree!&rdquo; sneered the other. &ldquo;Go to a lackeys' rout and dance
      with the kitchen maids. If I would, I could not present you to Bath
      society. I should have cartels from the fathers, brothers, and lovers of
      every wench and madam in the place, even I. You would be thrust from Lady
      Malbourne's door five minutes after you entered it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half the gentlemen in Bath have been here to play. They would know you,
      wouldn't they, fool? You've had thousands out of Bantison, Rakell,
      Guilford, and Townbrake. They would have you lashed by the grooms as your
      ugly deserts are. You to speak to Lady Mary Carlisle! 'Od's blood! You!
      Also, dolt, she would know you if you escaped the others. She stood within
      a yard of you when Nash expelled you the pump-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. Beaucaire flushed slightly. &ldquo;You think I did not see?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you dream that' because Winterset introduces a low fellow he will be
      tolerated&mdash;that Bath will receive a barber?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the distinction to call monsieur's attention,&rdquo; replied the young
      man gayly, &ldquo;I have renounce that profession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fool!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am now a man of honor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faugh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man of the parts,&rdquo; continued the the young Frenchman, &ldquo;and of
      deportment; is it not so? Have you seen me of a fluster, or gross ever,
      or, what sall I say&mdash;bourgeois? Shall you be shame' for your guest'
      manner? No, no! And my appearance, is it of the people? Clearly, no. Do I
      not compare in taste of apparel with your yo'ng Englishman? Ha, ha! To be
      hope'. Ha, ha! So I am goin' talk with Lady Mary Carlisle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; The Duke made a savage burlesque. &ldquo;'Lady Mary Carlisle, may I
      assume the honor of presenting the barber of the Marquis de Mirepoix?' So,
      is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monsieur,&rdquo; smiled the young man. &ldquo;Quite not so. You shall have
      nothing to worry you, nothing in the worl'. I am goin' to assassinate my
      poor mustachio&mdash;also remove this horrible black peruke, and emerge in
      my own hair. Behol'!&rdquo; He swept the heavy curled, mass from his head as he
      spoke, and his hair, coiled under the great wig, fell to his shoulders,
      and sparkled yellow in the candle-light. He tossed his head to shake the
      hair back from his cheeks. &ldquo;When it is dress', I am transform nobody can
      know me; you shall observe. See how little I ask of you, how very little
      bit. No one shall reco'nize 'M. Beaucaire' or 'Victor.' Ha, ha! 'Tis all
      arrange'; you have nothing to fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curse you,&rdquo; said the Duke, &ldquo;do you think I'm going to be saddled with you
      wherever I go as long as you choose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mistake. No. All I requi&mdash;All I beg&mdash;is this one evening.
      'Tis all shall be necessary. After, I shall not need monsieur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take heed to yourself&mdash;after!&rdquo; vouchsafed the Englishman between his
      teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Conquered!&rdquo; cried M. Beaucaire, and clapped his hands gleefully.
      &ldquo;Conquered for the night! Aha, it ts riz'nable! I shall meet what you send&mdash;after.
      One cannot hope too much of your patience. It is but natural you should
      attemp' a little avengement for the rascal trap I was such a wicked fellow
      as to set for you. I shall meet some strange frien's of yours after
      to-night; not so? I must try to be not too much frighten'.&rdquo; He looked at
      the Duke curiously. &ldquo;You want to know why I create this tragedy, why I am
      so unkind as to entrap monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His Grace of Winterset replied with a chill glance; a pulse in the
      nobleman's cheek beat less relentlessly; his eye raged not so bitterly;
      the steady purple of his own color was returning; his voice was less
      hoarse; he was regaining his habit. &ldquo;'Tis ever the manner of the vulgar,&rdquo;
       he observed, &ldquo;to wish to be seen with people of fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, no, no!&rdquo; The Frenchman laughed. &ldquo;'Tis not that. Am I not already
      one of these 'men of fashion'? I lack only the reputation of birth.
      Monsieur is goin' supply that. Ha, ha! I shall be noble from to-night.
      'Victor,' the artis', is condemn' to death; his throat shall be cut with
      his own razor. 'M. Beaucaire&mdash;'&rdquo; Here the young man sprang to his
      feet, caught up the black wig, clapped into it a dice-box from the table,
      and hurled it violently through the open door. &ldquo;'M. Beaucaire' shall be
      choke' with his own dice-box. Who is the Phoenix to remain? What advantage
      have I not over other men of rank who are merely born to it? I may choose
      my own. No! Choose for me, monsieur. Shall I be chevalier, comte, vicomte,
      marquis, what? None. Out of compliment to monsieur can I wish to be
      anything he is not? No, no! I shall be M. le Duc, M. le Duc de&mdash;de
      Chateaurien. Ha, ha! You see? You are my confrere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. Beaucaire trod a dainty step or two, waving his hand politely to the
      Duke, as though in invitation to join the celebration of his rank. The
      Englishman watched, his eye still and harsh, already gathering in
      craftiness. Beaucaire stopped suddenly. &ldquo;But how I forget my age! I am
      twenty-three,&rdquo; he said, with a sigh. &ldquo;I rejoice too much to be of the
      quality. It has been too great for me, and I had always belief' myself
      free of such ambition. I thought it was enough to behol' the opera without
      wishing to sing; but no, England have teach' me I have those vulgar
      desire'. Monsieur, I am goin' tell you a secret: the ladies of your
      country are very diff'runt than ours. One may adore the demoiselle, one
      must worship the lady of England. Our ladies have the&mdash;it is the
      beauty of youth; yours remain comely at thirty. Ours are flowers, yours
      are stars! See, I betray myself, I am so poor a patriot. And there is one
      among these stars&mdash;ah, yes, there is one&mdash;the poor Frenchman has
      observe' from his humble distance; even there he could bask in the
      glowing!&rdquo; M. Beaucaire turned to the window, and looked out into the dark.
      He did not see the lights of the town. When he turned again, he had half
      forgotten his prisoner; other pictures were before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, what radiance!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Those people up over the sky, they want to
      show they wish the earth to be happy, so they smile, and make this lady.
      Gold-haired, an angel of heaven, and yet a Diana of the chase! I see her
      fly by me on her great horse one day; she touch' his mane with her
      fingers. I buy that clipping from the groom. I have it here with my dear
      brother's picture. Ah, you! Oh, yes, you laugh! What do you know! 'Twas
      all I could get. But I have heard of the endeavor of M. le Duc to recoup
      his fortunes. This alliance shall fail. It is not the way&mdash;that
      heritage shall be safe' from him! It is you and me, monsieur! You can
      laugh! The war is open', and by me! There is one great step taken: until
      to-night there was nothing for you to ruin, to-morrow you have got a noble
      of France&mdash;your own protege&mdash;to besiege and sack. And you are to
      lose, because you think such ruin easy, and because you understand nothing&mdash;far
      less&mdash;of divinity. How could you know? You have not the fiber; the
      heart of a lady is a blank to you; you know nothing of the vibration.
      There are some words that were made only to tell of Lady Mary, for her
      alone&mdash;bellissima, divine, glorieuse! Ah, how I have watch' her! It
      is sad to me when I see her surround' by your yo'ng captains, your nobles,
      your rattles, your beaux&mdash;ha, ha!&mdash;and I mus' hol' far aloof. It
      is sad for me&mdash;but oh, jus' to watch her and to wonder! Strange it
      is, but I have almos' cry out with rapture at a look I have see' her give
      another man, so beautiful it was, so tender, so dazzling of the eyes and
      so mirthful of the lips. Ah, divine coquetry! A look for another, ah-i-me!
      for many others; and even to you, one day, a rose, while I&mdash;I,
      monsieur, could not even be so blessed as to be the groun' beneath her
      little shoe! But to-night, monsieur&mdash;ha, ha!&mdash;to-night,
      monsieur, you and me, two princes, M. le Duc de Winterset and M. le Duc de
      Chateaurien&mdash;ha, ha! you see?&mdash;we are goin' arm-in-arm to that
      ball, and I am goin' have one of those looks, I! And a rose! I! It is
      time. But ten minute', monsieur. I make my apology to keep you waitin' so
      long while I go in the nex' room and execute my poor mustachio&mdash;that
      will be my only murder for jus' this one evening&mdash;and inves' myself
      in white satin. Ha, ha! I shall be very gran', monsieur. Francois, send
      Louis to me; Victor, to order two chairs for monsieur and me; we are goin'
      out in the worl' to-right!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter Two
    </h2>
    <p>
      The chairmen swarmed in the street at Lady Malbourne's door, where the
      joyous vulgar fought with muddied footmen and tipsy link-boys for places
      of vantage whence to catch a glimpse of quality and of raiment at its
      utmost. Dawn was in the east, and the guests were departing. Singly or in
      pairs, glittering in finery, they came mincing down the steps, the ghost
      of the night's smirk fading to jadedness as they sought the dark recesses
      of their chairs. From within sounded the twang of fiddles still swinging
      manfully at it, and the windows were bright with the light of many
      candles. When the door was flung open to call the chair of Lady Mary
      Carlisle, there was an eager pressure of the throng to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      A small, fair gentleman in white satin came out upon the steps, turned and
      bowed before a lady who appeared in the doorway, a lady whose royal
      loveliness was given to view for a moment in that glowing frame. The crowd
      sent up a hearty English cheer for the Beauty of Bath.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman smiled upon them delightedly. &ldquo;What enchanting people!&rdquo; he
      cried. &ldquo;Why did I not know, so I might have shout' with them?&rdquo; The lady
      noticed the people not at all; whereat, being pleased, the people cheered
      again. The gentleman offered her his hand; she made a slow courtesy;
      placed the tips of her fingers upon his own. &ldquo;I am honored, M. de
      Chateaurien,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; he cried earnestly. &ldquo;Behol' a poor Frenchman whom emperors
      should envy.&rdquo; Then reverently and with the pride of his gallant office
      vibrant in every line of his slight figure, invested in white satin and
      very grand, as he had prophesied, M. le Duc de Chateaurien handed Lady
      Mary Carlisle down the steps, an achievement which had figured in the
      ambitions of seven other gentlemen during the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to be lef'in such onhappiness?&rdquo; he said in a low voice. &ldquo;That rose I
      have beg' for so long&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; said Lady Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I do not deserve it, I know so well! But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the greatness of my onworthiness that alone can claim your charity;
      let your kin' heart give this little red rose, this great alms, to the
      poor beggar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was seated in the chair. &ldquo;Ah, give the rose,&rdquo; he whispered. Her beauty
      shone dazzlingly on him out of the dimness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; she flashed defiantly as she was closed in. &ldquo;Never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rose fell at his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A rose lasts till morning,&rdquo; said a voice behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning, M. de Chateaurien looked beamingly upon the face of the Duke of
      Winterset.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis already the daylight,&rdquo; he replied, pointing to the east. &ldquo;Monsieur,
      was it not enough honor for you to han' out madame, the aunt of Lady Mary?
      Lady Rellerton retain much trace of beauty. 'Tis strange you did not
      appear more happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rose is of an unlucky color, I think,&rdquo; observed the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The color of a blush, my brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unlucky, I still maintain,&rdquo; said the other calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The color of the veins of a Frenchman. Ha, ha!&rdquo; cried the young man.
      &ldquo;What price would be too high? A rose is a rose! A good-night, my brother,
      a good-night. I wish you dreams of roses, red roses, only beautiful red,
      red roses!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay! Did you see the look she gave these street folk when they shouted
      for her? And how are you higher than they, when she knows? As high as
      yonder horse-boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Red roses, my brother, only roses. I wish you dreams of red, red roses!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter Three
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was well agreed by the fashion of Bath that M. le Duc de Chateaurien
      was a person of sensibility and haut ton; that his retinue and equipage
      surpassed in elegance; that his person was exquisite, his manner engaging.
      In the company of gentlemen his ease was slightly tinged with graciousness
      (his single equal in Bath being his Grace of Winterset); but it was
      remarked that when he bowed over a lady's hand, his air bespoke only a gay
      and tender reverence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was the idol of the dowagers within a week after his appearance;
      matrons warmed to him; young belles looked sweetly on him, while the
      gentlemen were won to admiration or envy. He was of prodigious wealth: old
      Mr. Bicksit, who dared not, for his fame's sake, fail to have seen all
      things, had visited Chateaurien under the present Duke's father, and
      descanted to the curious upon its grandeurs. The young noble had one
      fault, he was so poor a gambler. He cared nothing for the hazards of a die
      or the turn of a card. Gayly admitting that he had been born with no
      spirit of adventure in him, he was sure, he declared, that he failed of
      much happiness by his lack of taste in such matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was not long wanting the occasion to prove his taste in the matter
      of handling a weapon. A certain led-captain, Rohrer by name, notorious,
      amongst other things, for bearing a dexterous and bloodthirsty blade, came
      to Bath post-haste, one night, and jostled heartily against him, in the
      pump-room on the following morning. M. de Chauteaurien bowed, and turned
      aside without offense, continuing a conversation with some gentlemen near
      by. Captain Rohrer jostled against him a second time. M. de Chateaurien
      looked him in the eye, and apologized pleasantly for being so much in the
      way. Thereupon Rohrer procured an introduction to him, and made some
      observations derogatory to the valor and virtue of the French. There was
      current a curious piece of gossip of the French court: a prince of the
      blood royal, grandson of the late Regent and second in the line of
      succession to the throne of France, had rebelled against the authority of
      Louis XV, who had commanded him to marry the Princess Henriette, cousin to
      both of them. The princess was reported to be openly devoted to the cousin
      who refused to accept her hand at the bidding of the king; and, as rumor
      ran, the prince's caprice elected in preference the discipline of
      Vincennes, to which retirement the furious king had consigned him. The
      story was the staple gossip of all polite Europe; and Captain Rohrer,
      having in his mind a purpose to make use of it in leading up to a
      statement that should be general to the damage of all Frenchwomen, and
      which a Frenchman might not pass over as he might a jog of the elbow,
      repeated it with garbled truths to make a scandal of a story which bore
      none on a plain relation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not reach his deduction. M. de Chateaurien, breaking into his
      narrative, addressed him very quietly. &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;none but
      swine deny the nobleness of that good and gentle lady, Mademoiselle la
      Princesse de Bourbon-Conti. Every Frenchman know' that her cousin is a bad
      rebel and ingrate, who had only honor and rispec' for her, but was so
      wilful he could not let even the king say, 'You shall marry here, you
      shall marry there.' My frien's,&rdquo; the young man turned to the others, &ldquo;may
      I ask you to close roun' in a circle for one moment? It is clearly shown
      that the Duke of Orleans is a scurvy fellow, but not&mdash;&rdquo; he wheeled
      about and touched Captain Rohrer on the brow with the back of his gloved
      hand&mdash;&ldquo;but not so scurvy as thou, thou swine of the gutter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two hours later, with perfect ease, he ran Captain Rohrer through the left
      shoulder&mdash;after which he sent a basket of red roses to the Duke of
      Winterset. In a few days he had another captain to fight. This was a
      ruffling buck who had the astounding indiscretion to proclaim M. de
      Chateaurien an impostor. There was no Chateaurien, he swore. The Frenchman
      laughed in his face, and, at twilight of the same day, pinked him
      carefully through the right shoulder. It was not that he could not put
      aside the insult to himself, he declared to Mr. Molyneux, his second, and
      the few witnesses, as he handed his wet sword to his lackey&mdash;one of
      his station could not be insulted by a doubt of that station&mdash;but he
      fought in the quarrel of his friend Winterset. This rascal had asserted
      that M. le Duc had introduced an impostor. Could he overlook the insult to
      a friend, one to whom he owed his kind reception in Bath? Then, bending
      over his fallen adversary, he whispered: &ldquo;Naughty man, tell your master
      find some better quarrel for the nex' he sen' agains' me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conduct of M. de Chateaurien was pronounced admirable.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no surprise when the young foreigner fell naturally into the
      long train of followers of the beautiful Lady Mary Carlisle, nor was there
      great astonishment that he should obtain marked favor in her eyes, shown
      so plainly that my Lord Townbrake, Sir Hugh Guilford, and the rich Squire
      Bantison, all of whom had followed her through three seasons, swore with
      rage, and his Grace of Winterset stalked from her aunt's house with black
      brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meeting the Duke there on the evening after his second encounter de
      Chateaurien smiled upon him brilliantly. &ldquo;It was badly done; oh, so
      badly!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Can you afford to have me strip' of my mask by any
      but yourself? You, who introduce' me? They will say there is some bad
      scandal that I could force you to be my god-father. You mus' get the
      courage yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you a rose had a short life,&rdquo; was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, those roses! 'Tis the very greates' rizzon to gather each day a fresh
      one.&rdquo; He took a red bud from his breast for an instant, and touched it to
      his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. de Chateaurien!&rdquo; It was Lady Mary's voice; she stood at a table where
      a vacant place had been left beside her. &ldquo;M. de Chateaurien, we have been
      waiting very long for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke saw the look she did not know she gave the Frenchman, and he lost
      countenance for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We approach a climax, eh, monsieur?&rdquo; said M. de Chateaurien.

    <h2>
      Chapter Four
    </h2>
    <p>
      There fell a clear September night, when the moon was radiant over town
      and country, over cobbled streets and winding roads. From the fields the
      mists rose slowly, and the air was mild and fragrant, while distances were
      white and full of mystery. All of Bath that pretended to fashion or
      condition was present that evening at a fete at the house of a country
      gentleman of the neighborhood. When the stately junket was concluded, it
      was the pleasure of M. de Chateaurien to form one of the escort of Lady
      Mary's carriage for the return. As they took the road, Sir Hugh Guilford
      and Mr. Bantison, engaging in indistinct but vigorous remonstrance with
      Mr. Molyneux over some matter, fell fifty or more paces behind, where they
      continued to ride, keeping up their argument. Half a dozen other gallants
      rode in advance, muttering among themselves, or attended laxly upon Lady
      Mary's aunt on the other side of the coach, while the happy Frenchman was
      permitted to ride close to that adorable window which framed the fairest
      face in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sang for her a little French song, a song of the voyageur who dreamed
      of home. The lady, listening, looking up at the bright moon, felt a warm
      drop upon her cheek, and he saw the tears sparkling upon her lashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; he whispered then, &ldquo;I, too, have been a wanderer, but my
      dreams were not of France; no, I do not dream of that home, of that dear
      country. It is of a dearer country, a dream country&mdash;a country of
      gold and snow,&rdquo; he cried softly, looking it her white brow and the fair,
      lightly powdered hair above it. &ldquo;Gold and snow, and the blue sky of a
      lady's eyes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had thought the ladies of France were dark, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cruel! It is that she will not understan'! Have I speak of the ladies of
      France? No, no, no! It is of the faires' country; yes, 'tis a province of
      heaven, mademoiselle. Do I not renounce my allegiance to France? Oh, yes!
      I am subjec'&mdash;no, content to be slave&mdash;in the lan' of the blue
      sky, the gold, and the snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very pretty figure,&rdquo; answered Lady Mary, her eyes downcast. &ldquo;But does
      it not hint a notable experience in the making of such speeches?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tormentress! No. It prove only the inspiration it is to know you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We English ladies hear plenty of the like sir; and we even grow brilliant
      enough to detect the assurance that lies beneath the courtesies of our own
      gallants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merci! I should believe so!&rdquo; ejaculated M. de Chateaurien: but he
      smothered the words upon his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were not lifted. She went on: &ldquo;We come, in time, to believe that
      true feeling comes faltering forth, not glibly; that smoothness betokens
      the adept in the art, sir, rather than your true&mdash;your true&mdash;&rdquo;
       She was herself faltering; more, blushing deeply, and halting to a full
      stop in terror of a word. There was a silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your&mdash;true&mdash;lover,&rdquo; he said huskily. When he had said that word
      both trembled. She turned half away into the darkness of the coach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what make' you to doubt me,&rdquo; he said, faltering himself, though it
      was not his art that prompted him. &ldquo;They have tol' you the French do
      nothing always but make love, is it not so? Yes, you think I am like that.
      You think I am like that now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made no sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;I am unriz'nable; I would have the snow not so
      col'&mdash;for jus' me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn to me,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fragrance of the fields came to them, and from the distance the faint,
      clear note of a hunting-horn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lovely head was bent very low. Her little gloved hand lay upon the
      narrow window ledge. He laid his own gently upon it. The two hands were
      shaking like twin leaves in the breeze. Hers was not drawn away. After a
      pause, neither knew how long, he felt the warm fingers turn and clasp
      themselves tremulously about his own. At last she looked up bravely and
      met his eyes. The horn was wound again&mdash;nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the cold was gone from the snows&mdash;long ago,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My beautiful!&rdquo; he whispered; it was all he could say. &ldquo;My beautiful!&rdquo; But
      she clutched his arm, startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ware the road!&rdquo; A wild halloo sounded ahead. The horn wound loudly.
      &ldquo;'Ware the road!&rdquo; There sprang up out of the night a flying thunder of
      hoof-beats. The gentlemen riding idly in front of the coach scattered to
      the hedge-sides; and, with drawn swords flashing in the moon, a party of
      horsemen charged down the highway, their cries blasting the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barber! Kill the barber!&rdquo; they screamed. &ldquo;Barber! Kill the barber!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beaucaire had but time to draw his sword when they were upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A moi!&rdquo; his voice rang out clearly as he rose in his stirrups. &ldquo;A moi,
      Francois, Louis, Berquin! A moi, Francois!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cavaliers came straight at him. He parried the thrust of the first,
      but the shock of collision hurled his horse against the side of the coach.
      &ldquo;Sacred swine!&rdquo; he cried bitterly. &ldquo;To endanger a lady, to make this brawl
      in a lady's presence! Drive on!&rdquo; he shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Lady Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Frenchman's assailants were masked, but they were not highwaymen.
      &ldquo;Barber! Barber!&rdquo; they shouted hoarsely, and closed in on him in a circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See how he use his steel!&rdquo; laughed M. Beaucaire, as his point passed
      through a tawdry waistcoat. For a moment he cut through the ring and
      cleared a space about him, and Lady Mary saw his face shining in the
      moonlight. &ldquo;Canaille!&rdquo; he hissed, as his horse sank beneath him; and,
      though guarding his head from the rain of blows from above, he managed to
      drag headlong from his saddle the man who had hamstrung the poor brute.
      The fellow came suddenly to the ground, and lay there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it not a compliment,&rdquo; said a heavy voice, &ldquo;to bring six large men to
      subdue monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you are there, my frien'! In the rear&mdash;a little in the rear, I
      think. Ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Frenchman's play with his weapon was a revelation of skill, the more
      extraordinary as he held in his hand only a light dress sword. But the
      ring closed about him, and his keen defense could not avail him for more
      than a few moments. Lady Mary's outriders, the gallants of her escort,
      rode up close to the coach and encircled it, not interfering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Hugh Guilford!&rdquo; cried Lady Mary wildly, &ldquo;if you will not help him,
      give me your sword!&rdquo; She would have leaped to the ground, but Sir Hugh
      held the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit quiet, madam,&rdquo; he said to her; then, to the man on the box, &ldquo;Drive
      on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he does, I'll kill him!&rdquo; she said fiercely. &ldquo;Ah, what cowards! Will
      you see the Duke murdered?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Duke!&rdquo; laughed Guilford. &ldquo;They will not kill him, unless&mdash;be
      easy, dear madam, 'twill be explained. Gad's life!&rdquo; he muttered to
      Molyneux, &ldquo;'Twere time the varlet had his lashing! D'ye hear her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barber or no barber,&rdquo; answered Molyneux, &ldquo;I wish I had warned him. He
      fights as few gentlemen could. Ah&mdash;ah! Look at that! 'Tis a shame!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On foot, his hat gone, his white coat sadly rent and gashed, flecked, too,
      with red, M. Beaucaire, wary, alert, brilliant, seemed to transform
      himself into a dozen fencing-masters; and, though his skill appeared to
      lie in delicacy and quickness, his play being continually with the point,
      sheer strength failed to beat him down. The young man was laughing like a
      child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me,&rdquo; said Molyneux &ldquo;he's no barber! No, and never was!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment there was even a chance that M. Beaucaire might have the best
      of it. Two of his adversaries were prostrate, more than one were groaning,
      and the indomitable Frenchman had actually almost beat off the ruffians,
      when, by a trick, he was overcome. One of them, dismounting, ran in
      suddenly from behind, and seized his blade in a thick leather gauntlet.
      Before Beaucaire could disengage the weapon, two others threw themselves
      from their horses and hurled him to the earth. &ldquo;A moi! A moi, Francois!&rdquo;
       he cried as he went down, his sword in fragments, but his voice unbroken
      and clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shame!&rdquo; muttered one or two of the gentlemen about the coach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Twas dastardly to take him so,&rdquo; said Molyneux. &ldquo;Whatever his deservings,
      I'm nigh of a mind to offer him a rescue in the Duke's face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truss him up, lads,&rdquo; said the heavy voice. &ldquo;Clear the way in front of the
      coach. There sit those whom we avenge upon a presumptuous lackey. Now,
      Whiffen, you have a fair audience, lay on and baste him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two men began to drag M. Beaucaire toward a great oak by the roadside.
      Another took from his saddle a heavy whip with three thongs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A moi, Francois!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was borne on the breeze an answer&mdash;&ldquo;Monseigneur! Monseigneur!&rdquo;
       The cry grew louder suddenly. The clatter of hoofs urged to an anguish of
      speed sounded on the night. M. Beaucaire's servants had lagged sorely
      behind, but they made up for it now. Almost before the noise of their own
      steeds they came riding down the moonlit aisle between the mists. Chosen
      men, these servants of Beaucaire, and like a thunderbolt they fell upon
      the astounded cavaliers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chateaurien! Chateaurien!&rdquo; they shouted, and smote so swiftly that,
      through lack of time, they showed no proper judgment, discriminating
      nothing between non-combatants and their master's foes. They charged first
      into the group about M. Beaucaire, and broke and routed it utterly. Two of
      them leaped to the young man's side, while the other four, swerving,
      scarce losing the momentum of their onset, bore on upon the gentlemen near
      the coach, who went down beneath the fierceness of the onslaught, cursing
      manfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our just deserts,&rdquo; said Mr. Molyneux, his mouth full of dust and
      philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Hugh Guilford's horse fell with him, being literally ridden over, and
      the baronet's leg was pinned under the saddle. In less than ten minutes
      from the first attack on M. Beaucaire, the attacking party had fled in
      disorder, and the patrician non-combatants, choking with expletives,
      consumed with wrath, were prisoners, disarmed by the Frenchman's lackeys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guilford's discomfiture had freed the doors of the coach; so it was that
      when M. Beaucaire, struggling to rise, assisted by his servants, threw out
      one hand to balance himself, he found it seized between two small, cold
      palms, and he looked into two warm, dilating eyes, that were doubly
      beautiful because of the fright and rage that found room in them, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. le Duc Chateaurien sprang to his feet without the aid of his lackeys,
      and bowed low before Lady Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I make ten thousan' apology to be' the cause of a such melee in your
      presence,&rdquo; he said; and then, turning to Francois, he spoke in French:
      &ldquo;Ah, thou scoundrel! A little, and it had been too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francois knelt in the dust before him. &ldquo;Pardon!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Monseigneur
      commanded us to follow far in the rear, to remain unobserved. The wind
      malignantly blew against monseigneur's voice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See what it might have cost, my children,&rdquo; said his master, pointing to
      the ropes with which they would have bound him and to the whip lying
      beside them. A shudder passed over the lackey's frame; the utter horror in
      his face echoed in the eyes of his fellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, monseigneur!&rdquo; Francois sprang back, and tossed his arms to heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it did not happen,&rdquo; said M. Beaucaire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It could not!&rdquo; exclaimed Francois.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. And you did very well, my children&mdash;&rdquo; the young man smiled
      benevolently&mdash;&ldquo;very well. And now,&rdquo; he continued, turning to Lady
      Mary and speaking in English, &ldquo;let me be asking of our gallants yonder
      what make' them to be in cabal with highwaymen. One should come to a
      polite understanding with them, you think? Not so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed, offering his hand to conduct her to the coach, where Molyneux
      and his companions, having drawn Sir Hugh from under his horse, were
      engaged in reviving and reassuring Lady Rellerton, who had fainted. But
      Lady Mary stayed Beaucaire with a gesture, and the two stood where they
      were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur!&rdquo; she said, with a note of raillery in her voice, but
      raillery so tender that he started with happiness. His movement brought
      him a hot spasm of pain, and he clapped his hand to a red stain on his
      waistcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are hurt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nothing,&rdquo; smiled M. Beaucaire. Then, that she might not see the
      stain spreading, he held his handkerchief over the spot. &ldquo;I am a little&mdash;but
      jus' a trifling&mdash;bruise'; 'tis all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall ride in the coach,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Will you be pleased, M. de
      Chateaurien?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my beautiful!&rdquo; She seemed to wave before him like a shining mist. &ldquo;I
      wish that ride might las' for always! Can you say that, mademoiselle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; she cried in a passion of admiration, &ldquo;I would what you
      would have be, should be. What do you not deserve? You are the bravest man
      in the world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha! I am jus' a poor Frenchman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would that a few Englishmen had shown themselves as 'poor' tonight. The
      vile cowards, not to help you!&rdquo; With that, suddenly possessed by her
      anger, she swept away from him to the coach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Hugh, groaning loudly, was being assisted into the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My little poltroons,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what are you doing with your
      fellow-craven, Sir Hugh Guilford, there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; replied Molyneux humbly, &ldquo;Sir Hugh's leg is broken. Lady
      Rellerton graciously permits him to be taken in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not permit it! M. de Chateaurien rides with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir! Leave the wretch to groan by the roadside,&rdquo; she cried fiercely,
      &ldquo;which plight I would were that of all of you! But there will be a pretty
      story for the gossips to-morrow! And I could almost find pity for you when
      I think of the wits when you return to town. Fine gentlemen you; hardy
      bravos, by heaven! to leave one man to meet a troop of horse
      single-handed, while you huddle in shelter until you are overthrown and
      disarmed by servants! Oh, the wits! Heaven save you from the wits!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Address me no more! M. de Chateaurien, Lady Rellerton and I will greatly
      esteem the honor of your company. Will you come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stepped quickly into the coach, and was gathering her skirts to make
      room for the Frenchman, when a heavy voice spoke from the shadows of the
      tree by the wayside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Mary Carlisle will, no doubt, listen to a word of counsel on this
      point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke of Winterset rode out into the moonlight, composedly untieing a
      mask from about his head. He had not shared the flight of his followers,
      but had retired into the shade of the oak, whence he now made his presence
      known with the utmost coolness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious heavens, 'tis Winterset!&rdquo; exclaimed Lady Rellerton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turned highwayman and cut-throat,&rdquo; cried Lady Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; laughed M. Beaucaire, somewhat unsteadily, as he stood, swaying
      a little, with one hand on the coach-door, the other pressed hard on his
      side, &ldquo;he only oversee'; he is jus' a little bashful, sometime'. He is a
      great man, but he don' want all the glory!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barber,&rdquo; replied the Duke, &ldquo;I must tell you that I gladly descend to
      bandy words with you; your monstrous impudence is a claim to rank I cannot
      ignore. But a lackey who has himself followed by six other lackeys&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha! Has not M. le Duc been busy all this evening to justify me? And I
      think mine mus' be the bes' six. Ha, ha! You think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. de Chateaurien,&rdquo; said Lady Mary, &ldquo;we are waiting for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;He has something to say; maybe it is bes' if you
      hear it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to hear nothing from him&mdash;ever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My faith, madam,&rdquo; cried the Duke, &ldquo;this saucy fellow has paid you the
      last insult! He is so sure of you he does not fear you will believe the
      truth. When all is told, if you do not agree he deserved the lashing we
      planned to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll hear no more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will bitterly repent it, madam. For your own sake I entreat&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I also,&rdquo; broke in M. Beaucaire. &ldquo;Permit me, mademoiselle; let him
      speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let him be brief,&rdquo; said Lady Mary, &ldquo;for I am earnest to be quit of
      him. His explanation or an attack on my friend and on my carriage should
      be made to my brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas that he was not here,&rdquo; said the Duke, &ldquo;to aid me! Madam, was your
      carriage threatened? I have endeavored only to expunge a debt I owed to
      Bath and to avenge an insult offered to yourself through&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, sir, my patience will bear little more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousan' apology,&rdquo; said M. Beaucaire. &ldquo;You will listen, I only beg,
      Lady Mary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made an angry gesture of assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, I will be brief as I may. Two months ago there came to Bath a
      French gambler calling himself Beaucaire, a desperate fellow with the
      cards or dice, and all the men of fashion went to play at his lodging,
      where he won considerable sums. He was small, wore a black wig and
      mustachio. He had the insolence to show himself everywhere until the
      Master of Ceremonies rebuffed him in the pump-room, as you know, and after
      that he forbore his visits to the rooms. Mr. Nash explained (and was
      confirmed, madam, by indubitable information) that this Beaucaire was a
      man of unspeakable, vile, low birth, being, in fact, no other than a
      lackey of the French king's ambassador, Victor by name, de Mirepoix's
      barber. Although his condition was known, the hideous impudence of the
      fellow did not desert him, and he remained in Bath, where none would speak
      to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your farrago nigh done, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A few moments, madam. One evening, three weeks gone, I observed a very
      elegant equipage draw up to my door, and the Duke of Chateaurien was
      announced. The young man's manners were worthy&mdash;according to the
      French acceptance&mdash;and 'twere idle to deny him the most monstrous
      assurance. He declared himself a noble traveling for pleasure. He had
      taken lodgings in Bath for a season, he said, and called at once to pay
      his respects to me. His tone was so candid&mdash;in truth, I am the
      simplest of men, very easily gulled&mdash;and his stroke so bold, that I
      did not for one moment suspect him; and, to my poignant regret&mdash;though
      in the humblest spirit I have shown myself eager to atone&mdash;that very
      evening I had the shame of presenting him to yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The shame, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have patience, pray, madam. Ay, the shame! You know what figure he hath
      cut in Bath since that evening. All ran merrily with him until several
      days ago Captain Badger denounced him as an impostor, vowing that
      Chateaurien was nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon,&rdquo; interrupted M. Beaucaire. &ldquo;'Castle Nowhere' would have been so
      much better. Why did you not make him say it that way, monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Mary started; she was looking at the Duke, and her face was white. He
      continued: &ldquo;Poor Captain Badger was stabbed that same day.&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most befitting poor Captain Badger,&rdquo; muttered Molyneux.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;And his adversary had the marvelous insolence to declare
      that he fought in my quarrel! This afternoon the wounded man sent for me,
      and imparted a very horrifying intelligence. He had discovered a lackey
      whom he had seen waiting upon Beaucaire in attendance at the door of this
      Chateaurien's lodging. Beaucaire had disappeared the day before
      Chateaurien's arrival. Captain Badger looked closely at Chateaurien at
      their next meeting, and identified him with the missing Beaucaire beyond
      the faintest doubt. Overcome with indignation, he immediately proclaimed
      the impostor. Out of regard for me, he did not charge him with being
      Beaucaire; the poor soul was unwilling to put upon me the humiliation of
      having introduced a barber; but the secret weighed upon him till he sent
      for me and put everything in my hands. I accepted the odium; thinking only
      of atonement. I went to Sir John Wimpledon's. I took poor Sir Hugh, there,
      and these other gentlemen aside, and told them my news. We narrowly
      observed this man, and were shocked at our simplicity in not having
      discovered him before. These are men of honor and cool judgment, madam.
      Mr. Molyneux had acted for him in the affair of Captain Badger, and was
      strongly prejudiced in his favor; but Mr. Molyneux, Sir Hugh, Mr.
      Bantison, every one of them, in short, recognized him. In spite of his
      smooth face and his light hair, the adventurer Beaucaire was writ upon him
      amazing plain. Look at him, madam, if he will dare the inspection. You saw
      this Beaucaire well, the day of his expulsion from the rooms. Is not this
      he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. Beaucaire stepped close to her. Her pale face twitched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, oh!&rdquo; she whispered with a dry throat, and fell back in the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it so?&rdquo; cried the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know.&mdash;I&mdash;cannot tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment more. I begged these gentlemen to allow me to wipe out the
      insult I had unhappily offered to Bath, but particularly to you. They
      agreed not to forestall me or to interfere. I left Sir John Wimpledon's
      early, and arranged to give the sorry rascal a lashing under your own
      eyes, a satisfaction due the lady into whose presence he had dared to
      force himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Noblesse oblige'?&rdquo; said M. Beaucaire in a tone of gentle inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, madam,&rdquo; said the Duke, &ldquo;I will detain you not one second longer.
      I plead the good purpose of my intentions, begging you to believe that the
      desire to avenge a hateful outrage, next to the wish to serve you, forms
      the dearest motive in the heart of Winterset.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; cried Beaucaire softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Mary leaned toward him, a thriving terror in her eyes. &ldquo;It is false?&rdquo;
       she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur should not have been born so high. He could have made little
      book'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean it is false?&rdquo; she cried breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Od's blood, is she not convinced?&rdquo; broke out Mr. Bantison. &ldquo;Fellow, were
      you not the ambassador's barber?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all false?&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mos' fine art, mademoiselle. How long you think it take M. de
      Winterset to learn that speech after he write it out? It is a mix of what
      is true and the mos' chaste art. Monsieur has become a man of letters.
      Perhaps he may enjoy that more than the wars. Ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bantison burst into a roar of laughter. &ldquo;Do French gentlemen fight
      lackeys? Ho, ho, ho! A pretty country! We English do as was done to-night,
      have our servants beat them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And attend ourselves,&rdquo; added M. Beaucaire, looking at the Duke, &ldquo;somewhat
      in the background? But, pardon,&rdquo; he mocked, &ldquo;that remind' me. Francois,
      return to Mr. Bantison and these gentlemen their weapons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you answer a question?&rdquo; said Molyneux mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, with pleasure, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you ever a barber?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monsieur,&rdquo; laughed the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pah!&rdquo; exclaimed Bantison. &ldquo;Let me question him. Now, fellow, a confession
      may save you from jail. Do you deny you are Beaucaire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deny to a such judge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said Bantison. &ldquo;What more do you want, Molyneux? Fellow, do you deny
      that you came to London in the ambassador's suite?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I do not deny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He admits it! Didn't you come as his barber?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my frien', as his barber.&rdquo; Lady Mary cried out faintly, and,
      shuddering, put both hands over her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry,&rdquo; said Molyneux. &ldquo;You fight like a gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You called yourself Beaucaire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur.&rdquo; He was swaying to and fro; his servants ran to support
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish&mdash;&rdquo; continued Molyneux, hesitating. &ldquo;Evil take me!&mdash;but
      I'm sorry you're hurt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assist Sir Hugh into my carriage,&rdquo; said Lady Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell, mademoiselle!&rdquo; M. Beaucaire's voice was very faint. His eyes
      were fixed upon her face. She did not look toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were propping Sir Hugh on the cushions. The Duke rode up close to
      Beaucaire, but Francois seized his bridle fiercely, and forced the horse
      back on its haunches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man's servants worship him,&rdquo; said Molyneux.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curse your insolence!&rdquo; exclaimed the Duke. &ldquo;How much am I to bear from
      this varlet and his varlets? Beaucaire, if you have not left Bath by
      to-morrow noon, you will be clapped into jail, and the lashing you escaped
      to-night shall be given you thrice tenfold!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be-in the&mdash;Assemily&mdash;Room' at nine&mdash;o'clock, one
      week &mdash;from&mdash;to-night,&rdquo; answered the young man, smiling
      jauntily, though his lips were colorless. The words cost him nearly all
      his breath and strength. &ldquo;You mus' keep&mdash;in the&mdash;backgroun',
      monsieur. Ha, ha!&rdquo; The door of the coach closed with a slam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle&mdash;fare&mdash;well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drive on!&rdquo; said Lady Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Beaucaire followed the carriage with his eyes. As the noise of the
      wheels and the hoof-beats of the accompanying cavalcade grew fainter in
      the distance, the handkerchief he had held against his side dropped into
      the white dust, a heavy red splotch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only&mdash;roses,&rdquo; he gasped, and fell back in the arms of his servants.

    <h2>
      Chapter Five
    </h2>
    <p>
      Beau Nash stood at the door of the rooms, smiling blandly upon a dainty
      throng in the pink of its finery and gay furbelows. The great exquisite
      bent his body constantly in a series of consummately adjusted bows: before
      a great dowager, seeming to sweep the floor in august deference; somewhat
      stately to the young bucks; greeting the wits with gracious friendliness
      and a twinkle of raillery; inclining with fatherly gallantry before the
      beauties; the degree of his inclination measured the altitude of the
      recipient as accurately as a nicely calculated sand-glass measures the
      hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King of Bath was happy, for wit, beauty, fashion&mdash;to speak more
      concretely: nobles, belles, gamesters, beaux, statesmen, and poets &mdash;made
      fairyland (or opera bouffe, at least) in his dominions; play ran higher
      and higher, and Mr. Nash's coffers filled up with gold. To crown his
      pleasure, a prince of the French blood, the young Comte de Beaujolais,
      just arrived from Paris, had reached Bath at noon in state, accompanied by
      the Marquis de Mirepoix, the ambassador of Louis XV. The Beau dearly
      prized the society of the lofty, and the present visit was an honor to
      Bath: hence to the Master of Ceremonies. What was better, there would be
      some profitable hours with the cards and dice. So it was that Mr. Nash
      smiled never more benignly than on that bright evening. The rooms rang
      with the silvery voices of women and delightful laughter, while the
      fiddles went merrily, their melodies chiming sweetly with the joyance of
      his mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The skill and brazen effrontery of the ambassador's scoundrelly servant in
      passing himself off for a man of condition formed the point of departure
      for every conversation. It was discovered that there were but three
      persons present who had not suspected him from the first; and, by a
      singular paradox, the most astute of all proved to be old Mr. Bicksit, the
      traveler, once a visitor at Chateaurien; for he, according to report, had
      by a coup of diplomacy entrapped the impostor into an admission that there
      was no such place. However, like poor Captain Badger, the worthy old man
      had held his peace out of regard for the Duke of Winterset. This nobleman,
      heretofore secretly disliked, suspected of irregular devices at play, and
      never admired, had won admiration and popularity by his remorse for the
      mistake, and by the modesty of his attitude in endeavoring to atone for
      it, without presuming upon the privilege of his rank to laugh at the
      indignation of society; an action the more praiseworthy because his
      exposure of the impostor entailed the disclosure of his own culpability in
      having stood the villain's sponsor. To-night, the happy gentleman, with
      Lady Mary Carlisle upon his arm, went grandly about the rooms, sowing and
      reaping a harvest of smiles. 'Twas said work would be begun at once to
      rebuild the Duke's country seat, while several ruined Jews might be paid
      out of prison. People gazing on the beauty and the stately but modest hero
      by her side, said they would make a noble pair. She had long been
      distinguished by his attentions, and he had come brilliantly out of the
      episode of the Frenchman, who had been his only real rival. Wherever they
      went, there arose a buzz of pleasing gossip and adulation. Mr. Nash,
      seeing them near him, came forward with greetings. A word on the side
      passed between the nobleman and the exquisite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had news of the rascal tonight,&rdquo; whispered Nash. &ldquo;He lay at a farm till
      yesterday, when he disappeared; his ruffians, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have arranged?&rdquo; asked the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fourteen bailiffs are watching without. He could not come within gunshot.
      If they clap eyes on him, they will hustle him to jail, and his cutthroats
      shall not avail him a hair's weight. The impertinent swore he'd be here by
      nine, did he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said so; and 'tis a rash dog, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is just nine now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send out to see if they have taken him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gladly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Beau beckoned an attendant, and whispered in his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of the crowd had edged up to the two gentlemen with apparent
      carelessness, to overhear their conversation. Those who did overhear
      repeated it in covert asides, and this circulating undertone, confirming a
      vague rumor that Beaucaire would attempt the entrance that night, lent a
      pleasurable color of excitement to the evening. The French prince, the
      ambassador, and their suites were announced. Polite as the assembly was,
      it was also curious, and there occurred a mannerly rush to see the
      newcomers. Lady Mary, already pale, grew whiter as the throng closed round
      her; she looked up pathetically at the Duke, who lost no time in
      extricating her from the pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait here,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I will fetch you a glass of negus,&rdquo; and
      disappeared. He had not thought to bring a chair, and she, looking about
      with an increasing faintness and finding none, saw that she was standing
      by the door of a small side-room. The crowd swerved back for the passage
      of the legate of France, and pressed upon her. She opened the door, and
      went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was empty save for two gentlemen, who were quietly playing cards
      at a table. They looked up as she entered. They were M. Beaucaire and Mr.
      Molyneux.
    </p>
    <p>
      She uttered a quick cry and leaned against the wall, her hand to her
      breast. Beaucaire, though white and weak, had brought her a chair before
      Molyneux could stir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not touch me!&rdquo; she said, with such frozen abhorrence in her voice that
      he stopped short. &ldquo;Mr. Molyneux, you seek strange company!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; replied Molyneux, bowing deeply, as much to Beaucaire as to
      herself, &ldquo;I am honored by the presence of both of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, are you mad!&rdquo; she exclaimed, contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This gentleman has exalted me with his confidence, madam,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you add your ruin to the scandal of this fellow's presence here? How
      he obtained entrance&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon, mademoiselle,&rdquo; interrupted Beaucaire. &ldquo;Did I not say I should
      come? M. Molyneux was so obliging as to answer for me to the fourteen
      frien's of M. de Winterset and Meestaire Nash.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not know,&rdquo; she turned vehemently upon Molyneux, &ldquo;that he will be
      removed the moment I leave this room? Do you wish to be dragged out with
      him? For your sake, sir, because I have always thought you a man of heart,
      I give you a chance to save yourself from disgrace&mdash;and&mdash;your
      companion from jail. Let him slip out by some retired way, and you may
      give me your arm and we will enter the next room as if nothing had
      happened. Come, sir&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Molyneux, I desire to hear nothing from your companion. Had I not
      seen you at cards with him I should have supposed him in attendance as
      your lackey. Do you desire to take advantage of my offer, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle, I could not tell you, on that night&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may inform your high-born friend, Mr. Molyneux, that I heard
      everything he had to say; that my pride once had the pleasure of listening
      to his high-born confession!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, it is gentle to taunt one with his birth, mademoiselle? Ah, no! There
      is a man in my country who say strange things of that&mdash;that a man is
      not his father, but himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may inform your friend, Mr. Molyneux, that he had a chance to defend
      himself against accusation; that he said all&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I did say all I could have strength to say. Mademoiselle, you did
      not see&mdash;as it was right&mdash;that I had been stung by a big wasp.
      It was nothing, a scratch; but, mademoiselle, the sky went round and the
      moon dance' on the earth. I could not wish that big wasp to see he had
      stung me; so I mus' only say what I can have strength for, and stand
      straight till he is gone. Beside', there are other rizzons. Ah, you mus'
      belief! My Molyneux I sen' for, and tell him all, because he show courtesy
      to the yo'ng Frenchman, and I can trus' him. I trus' you, mademoiselle&mdash;long
      ago&mdash;and would have tol' you ev'rything, excep' jus' because&mdash;well,
      for the romance, the fon! You belief? It is so clearly so; you do belief,
      mademoiselle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not even look at him. M. Beaucaire lifted his hand appealingly
      toward her. &ldquo;Can there be no faith in&mdash;in&mdash;he said timidly, and
      paused. She was silent, a statue, my Lady Disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had not belief' me to be an impostor; if I had never said I was
      Chateaurien; if I had been jus' that Monsieur Beaucaire of the story they
      tol' you, but never with the heart of a lackey, an hones' man, a man, the
      man you knew, himself, could you&mdash;would you&mdash;&rdquo; He was trying to
      speak firmly; yet, as he gazed upon her splendid beauty, he choked
      slightly, and fumbled in the lace at his throat with unsteady fingers.&mdash;&ldquo;Would
      you&mdash;have let me ride by your side in the autumn moonlight?&rdquo; Her
      glance passed by him as it might have passed by a footman or a piece of
      furniture. He was dressed magnificently, a multitude of orders glittering
      on his breast. Her eye took no knowledge of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle-I have the honor to ask you: if you had known this Beaucaire
      was hones', though of peasant birth, would you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Involuntarily, controlled as her icy presence was, she shuddered. There
      was a moment of silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Molyneux,&rdquo; said Lady Mary, &ldquo;in spite of your discourtesy in allowing
      a servant to address me, I offer you a last chance to leave this room
      undisgraced. Will you give me your arm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, madam,&rdquo; said Mr. Molyneux.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beaucaire dropped into a chair with his head bent low and his arm
      outstretched on the table; his eyes filled slowly in spite of himself, and
      two tears rolled down the young man's cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' live men are jus'&mdash;names!&rdquo; said M. Beaucaire.

    <h2>
      Chapter Six
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the outer room, Winterset, unable to find Lady Mary, and supposing her
      to have joined Lady Rellerton, disposed of his negus, then approached the
      two visitors to pay his respects to the young prince, whom he discovered
      to be a stripling of seventeen, arrogant looking, but pretty as a girl.
      Standing beside the Marquis de Mirepoix&mdash;a man of quiet bearing&mdash;he
      was surrounded by a group of the great, among whom Mr. Nash naturally
      counted himself. The Beau was felicitating himself that the foreigners had
      not arrived a week earlier, in which case he and Bath would have been
      detected in a piece of gross ignorance concerning the French nobility&mdash;making
      much of de Mirepoix's ex-barber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis a lucky thing that fellow was got out of the way,&rdquo; he ejaculated,
      under cover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank me for it,&rdquo; rejoined Winterset.
    </p>
    <p>
      An attendant begged Mr. Nash's notice. The head bailiff sent word that
      Beaucaire had long since entered the building by a side door. It was
      supposed Mr. Nash had known of it, and the Frenchman was not arrested, as
      Mr. Molyneux was in his company, and said he would be answerable for him.
      Consternation was so plain on the Beau's trained face that the Duke leaned
      toward him anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The villain's in, and Molyneux hath gone mad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bantison, who had been fiercely elbowing his way toward them, joined
      heads with them. &ldquo;You may well say he is in,&rdquo; he exclaimed &ldquo;and if you
      want to know where, why, in yonder card-room. I saw him through the
      half-open door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's to be done?&rdquo; asked the Beau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send the bailiffs&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fie, fie! A file of bailiffs? The scandal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then listen to me,&rdquo; said the Duke. &ldquo;I'll select half-a-dozen gentlemen,
      explain the matter, and we'll put him in the center of us and take him out
      to the bailiffs. 'Twill appear nothing. Do you remain here and keep the
      attention of Beaujolais and de Mirepoix. Come, Bantison, fetch Townbrake
      and Harry Rakell yonder; I'll bring the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Three minutes later, his Grace of Winterset flung wide the card-room door,
      and, after his friends had entered, closed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; remarked M. Beaucaire quietly. &ldquo;Six more large men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke, seeing Lady Mary, started; but the angry signs of her interview
      had not left her face, and reassured him. He offered his hand to conduct
      her to the door. &ldquo;May I have the honor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this is to be known, 'twill be better if I leave after; I should be
      observed if I went now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you will, madam,&rdquo; he answered, not displeased. &ldquo;And now, you impudent
      villain,&rdquo; he began, turning to M. Beaucaire, but to fall back astounded.
      &ldquo;'Od's blood, the dog hath murdered and robbed some royal prince!&rdquo; He
      forgot Lady Mary's presence in his excitement. &ldquo;Lay hands on him!&rdquo; he
      shouted. &ldquo;Tear those orders from him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Molyneux threw himself between. &ldquo;One word!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;One word before you
      offer an outrage you will repent all your lives!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or let M. de Winterset come alone,&rdquo; laughed M. Beaucaire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you expect me to fight a cut-throat barber, and with bare hands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think one does not expec' monsieur to fight anybody. Would I fight you,
      you think? That was why I had my servants, that evening we play. I would
      gladly fight almos' any one in the won'; but I did not wish to soil my
      hand with a&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stuff his lying mouth with his orders!&rdquo; shouted the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Molyneux still held the gentlemen back. &ldquo;One moment,&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. de Winterset,&rdquo; said Beaucaire, &ldquo;of what are you afraid? You calculate
      well. Beaucaire might have been belief&mdash;an impostor that you yourself
      expose'? Never! But I was not goin' reveal that secret. You have not
      absolve me of my promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell what you like,&rdquo; answered the Duke. &ldquo;Tell all the wild lies you have
      time for. You have five minutes to make up your mind to go quietly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you absolve me, then? Ha, ha! Oh, yes! Mademoiselle,&rdquo; he bowed to
      Lady Mary, &ldquo;I have the honor to reques' you leave the room. You shall miss
      no details if these frien's of yours kill me, on the honor of a French
      gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A French what?&rdquo; laughed Bantison.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you dare keep up the pretense?&rdquo; cried Lord Town brake. &ldquo;Know, you
      villain barber, that your master, the Marquis de Mirepoix, is in the next
      room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Molyneux heaved a great sigh of relief. &ldquo;Shall I&mdash;&rdquo; He turned to M.
      Beaucaire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man laughed, and said: &ldquo;Tell him come here at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impudent to the last!&rdquo; cried Bantison, as Molyneux hurried from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you goin' to see M. Beaucaire's master,&rdquo; said Beaucaire to Lady Mary.
      &ldquo;'Tis true what I say, the other night. I cross from Prance in his suite;
      my passport say as his barber. Then to pass the ennui of exile, I come to
      Bath and play for what one will. It kill the time. But when the people
      hear I have been a servant they come only secretly; and there is one of
      them&mdash;he has absolve' me of a promise not to speak&mdash;of him I
      learn something he cannot wish to be tol'. I make some trouble to learn
      this thing. Why I should do this? Well&mdash;that is my own rizzon. So I
      make this man help me in a masque, the unmasking it was, for, as there is
      no one to know me, I throw off my black wig and become myself&mdash;and so
      I am 'Chateaurien,' Castle Nowhere. Then this man I use', this Winterset,
      he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have great need to deny these accusations?&rdquo; said the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Lady Mary wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I tell you why I mus' be 'Victor' and 'Beaucaire' and
      'Chateaurien,' and not myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To escape from the bailiffs for debts for razors and soap,&rdquo; gibed Lord
      Townbrake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monsieur. In France I have got a cousin who is a man with a very bad
      temper at some time', and he will never enjoy his relatives to do what he
      does not wish&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was interrupted by a loud commotion from without. The door was flung
      open, and the young Count of Beaujolais bounded in and threw his arms
      about the neck of M. Beaucaire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philippe!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;My brother, I have come to take you back with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. de Mirepoix followed him, bowing as a courtier, in deference; but M.
      Beaucaire took both his hands heartily. Molyneux came after, with Mr.
      Nash, and closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My warmest felicitations,&rdquo; said the Marquis. &ldquo;There is no longer need for
      your incognito.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou best of masters!&rdquo; said Beaucaire, touching him fondly on the
      shoulder. &ldquo;I know. Your courier came safely. And so I am forgiven! But I
      forget.&rdquo; He turned to the lady. She had begun to tremble exceedingly.
      &ldquo;Faires' of all the English fair,&rdquo; he said, as the gentlemen bowed low to
      her deep courtesy, &ldquo;I beg the honor to presen' to Lady Mary Carlisle, M.
      le Comte de Beaujolais. M. de Mirepoix has already the honor. Lady Mary
      has been very kind to me, my frien's; you mus' help me make my
      acknowledgment. Mademoiselle and gentlemen, will you give me that favour
      to detain you one instan'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henri,&rdquo; he turned to the young Beaujolais, &ldquo;I wish you had shared my
      masque&mdash;I have been so gay!&rdquo; The surface of his tone was merry, but
      there was an undercurrent, weary&mdash;sad, to speak of what was the mood,
      not the manner. He made the effect of addressing every one present, but he
      looked steadily at Lady Mary. Her eyes were fixed upon him, with a silent
      and frightened fascination, and she trembled more and more. &ldquo;I am a great
      actor, Henri. These gentlemen are yet scarce convince' I am not a lackey!
      And I mus' tell you that I was jus' now to be expelled for having been a
      barber!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; the ambassador cried out. &ldquo;He would not be content with me; he
      would wander over a strange country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha, my Mirepoix! And what is better, one evening I am oblige' to
      fight some frien's of M. de Winterset there, and some ladies and cavaliers
      look on, and they still think me a servant. Oh, I am a great actor! 'Tis
      true there is not a peasant in France who would not have then known one
      'born'; but they are wonderful, this English people, holding by an idea
      once it is in their heads&mdash;a mos' worthy quality. But my good
      Molyneux here, he had speak to me with courtesy, jus' because I am a man
      an' jus' because he is always kind. (I have learn' that his
      great-grandfather was a Frenchman.) So I sen' to him and tell him
      ev'rything, and he gain admittance for me here to-night to await my
      frien's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was speaking to messieurs about my cousin, who will meddle in the
      affair' of his relatives. Well, that gentleman, he make a marriage for me
      with a good and accomplish' lady, very noble and very beautiful&mdash;and
      amiable.&rdquo; (The young count at his elbow started slightly at this, but
      immediately appeared to wrap himself in a mantle of solemn thought.)
      &ldquo;Unfortunately, when my cousin arrange' so, I was a dolt, a little
      blockhead; I swear to marry for myself and when I please, or never if I
      like. That lady is all things charming and gentle, and, in truth, she is&mdash;very
      much attach' to me&mdash;why should I not say it? I am so proud of it. She
      is very faithful and forgiving and sweet; she would be the same, I think,
      if I&mdash;were even&mdash;a lackey. But I? I was a dolt, a little
      unsensible brute; I did not value such thing' then; I was too yo'ng, las'
      June. So I say to my cousin, 'No, I make my own choosing!' 'Little fool,'
      he answer, 'she is the one for you. Am I not wiser than you?' And he was
      very angry, and, as he has influence in France, word come' that he will
      get me put in Vincennes, so I mus' run away quick till his anger is gone.
      My good frien' Mirepoix is jus' leaving for London; he take' many risk'
      for my sake; his hairdresser die before he start', so I travel as that
      poor barber. But my cousin is a man to be afraid of when he is angry, even
      in England, and I mus' not get my Mirepoix in trouble. I mus' not be
      discover' till my cousin is ready to laugh about it all and make it a
      joke. And there may be spies; so I change my name again, and come to Bath
      to amuse my retreat with a little gaming&mdash;I am always fond of that.
      But three day' ago M. le Marquis send me a courier to say that my brother,
      who know where I had run away, is come from France to say that my cousin
      is appease'; he need me for his little theatre, the play cannot go on. I
      do not need to espouse mademoiselle. All shall be forgiven if I return,
      and my brother and M. de Mirepoix will meet me in Bath to felicitate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one more thing to say, that is all. I have said I learn' a
      secret, and use it to make a man introduce me if I will not tell. He has
      absolve' me of that promise. My frien's, I had not the wish to ruin that
      man. I was not receive'; Meestaire Nash had reboff me; I had no other way
      excep' to use this fellow. So I say, 'Take me to Lady Malbourne's ball as
      &ldquo;Chateaurien.&rdquo;' I throw off my wig, and shave, and behol', I am M. le Duc
      de Castle Nowhere. Ha, ha! You see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man's manner suddenly changed. He became haughty, menacing. He
      stretched out his arm, and pointed at Winterset. &ldquo;Now I am no 'Beaucaire,'
      messieurs. I am a French gentleman. The man who introduce' me at the price
      of his honor, and then betray' me to redeem it, is that coward, that
      card-cheat there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winterset made a horrible effort to laugh. The gentlemen who surrounded
      him fell away as from pestilence. &ldquo;A French gentleman!&rdquo; he sneered
      savagely, and yet fearfully. &ldquo;I don't know who you are. Hide behind as
      many toys and ribbons as you like; I'll know the name of the man who dares
      bring such a charge!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; cried de Mirepoix sharply, advancing a step towards him; but he
      checked himself at once. He made a low bow of state, first to the young
      Frenchman, then to Lady Mary and the company. &ldquo;Permit me, Lady Mary and
      gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to assume the honor of presenting you to His
      Highness, Prince Louis-Philippe de Valois, Duke of Orleans, Duke of
      Chartres, Duke of Nemours, Duke of Montpeti'sier, First Prince of the
      Blood Royal, First Peer of France, Lieutenant-General of French Infantry,
      Governor of Dauphine, Knight of the Golden Fleece, Grand Master of the
      Order of Notre Dame, of Mount Carmel, and of St. Lazarus in Jerusalem; and
      cousin to His most Christian Majesty, Louis the Fifteenth, King of
      France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those are a few of my brother's names,&rdquo; whispered Henri of Beaujolais to
      Molyneux. &ldquo;Old Mirepoix has the long breath, but it take' a strong man two
      day' to say all of them. I can suppose this Winterset know' now who bring
      the charge!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Castle Nowhere!&rdquo; gasped Beau Nash, falling back upon the burly prop of
      Mr. Bantison's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Duke of Orleans will receive a message from me within the hour!&rdquo; said
      Winterset, as he made his way to the door. His face was black with rage
      and shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tol' you that I would not soil my hand with you,&rdquo; answered the young
      man. &ldquo;If you send a message no gentleman will bring it. Whoever shall bear
      it will receive a little beating from Francois.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stepped to Lady Mary's side. Her head was bent low, her face averted.
      She seemed to breathe with difficulty, and leaned heavily upon a chair.
      &ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; she faltered in a half whisper, &ldquo;can you&mdash;forgive me?
      It is a bitter&mdash;mistake-I have made. Forgive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive?&rdquo; he answered, and his voice was as broken as hers; but he went
      on, more firmly: &ldquo;It is&mdash;nothing&mdash;less than nothing. There is&mdash;only
      jus' one&mdash;in the&mdash;whole worl' who would not have treat' me the
      way that you treat' me. It is to her that I am goin' to make reparation.
      You know something, Henri? I am not goin' back only because the king
      forgive' me. I am goin' to please him; I am goin' to espouse mademoiselle,
      our cousin. My frien's, I ask your felicitations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the king does not compel him!&rdquo; exclaimed young Henri.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henri, you want to fight me?&rdquo; cried his brother sharply. &ldquo;Don' you think
      the King of France is a wiser man than me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He offered his hand to Lady Mary. &ldquo;Mademoiselle is fatigue'. Will she
      honor me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked with her to the door. Her hand fluttering faintly in his. From
      somewhere about the garments of one of them a little cloud of faded
      rose-leaves fell, and lay strewn on the floor behind them. He opened the
      door, and the lights shone on a multitude of eager faces turned toward it.
      There was a great hum of voices, and, over all, the fiddles wove a
      wandering air, a sweet French song of the voyageur.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed very low, as, with fixed and glistening eyes, Lady Mary Carlisle,
      the Beauty of Bath, passed slowly by him and went out of the room.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
